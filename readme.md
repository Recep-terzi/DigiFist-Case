#	DigiFist - Case

----------

* Since I received an error in using the fonts given in the custom fonts section of the project, I transferred it to the project myself.
* I avoided unnecessary code repetition while coding the project.
* Instead of using CSS frameworks, I performed lean CSS coding.
* I try to use the BEM (Block Element Modifier) naming convention to keep the class names meaningful and organized.
* I coded the draggable codes in the scroll part of the products with Javascript.
