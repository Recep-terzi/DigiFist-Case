#	DigiFist - Case

----------

* Since I received an error in using the fonts given in the custom fonts section of the project, I transferred it to the project myself.
* I avoided unnecessary code repetition while coding the project.
* Instead of using CSS frameworks, I performed lean CSS coding.
* I coded the draggable codes in the scroll part of the products with Javascript.

You can find the pictures of the project I coded below.
